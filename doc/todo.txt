1.The Module of new own model format and The tool application transfer the new model format to the standardised model
format (COLLADA).
//2.Mesh bounds is not applicable at sample texture array.
3.Move pipeline state of VertexData and IndexData to their sub datas.
4.Optimize visibility check. Objects in scene should check if in the bounds of camera view in the world, and then we calculate
the objects in the view bounds clip rectangle. (In this way, the complexities of transfroming bounds and calculating clip rectangle
turn to constant.)
